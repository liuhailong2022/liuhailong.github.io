# PROJECT PRESENTATION

## Requirements
  1. Show the navigation between all the sections.
  2. Explain each page and how it was built. Explain why you chose the fonts/colours and layout
  if necessary.
  3. For each page, demonstrate the responsive nature of the page. You can use the developer
  tools to simulate a phone screen (as shown in class).
  4. Show the code behind the contact-me page, and make sure to mention how you did the
  validation here.
  5. Show the code for the server page (php) that the contact-me page links to.
  6. Importantly, mention what one or two parts of the project were most challenging to you and
  what you did to overcome the challenges.
  7. As a bonus, include a TIP that wasn't shown in class, that might make the web page look or
  behave better. This can also include 3rd party tools if you wish.
